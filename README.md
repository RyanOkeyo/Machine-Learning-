Machine Learning projects 
This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various features using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality dataset, freely available on the internet. The dataset contains fundamental features that influence the quality of wine. By employing several machine learning models, we aim to predict the quality of wine accurately.
